/* DESCRIPTION
The Italian mathematician Fibonacci once devised a sequence to model the growth of rabbit populations (one pair would
procreate after two months and then every subsequent month produce another pair which would also procreate after two months

In fact, his sequence turned out to be very bad at modeling rabbit populations, but it is very popular for introductory
computer science courses.

The logic in the sequence is simple: you start with 1 1, and every next number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
So you get a series like 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ... (1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8, 5+8=13 etc.)

Create a program that asks for the number of Fibonacci numbers to calculate. So if the user wants 10 Fibonacci
numbers, the program should produce 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55

Note that if you try larger numbers than 10 (actually, more than 46 numbers), the next Fibonacci numbers become
negative! Mathematically, that should be impossible, but
1134903170 + 1836311903 = 2971215073 (2_971_215_073), which is bigger than the maximum number that fits into a Java
integer (Integer.MAX_VALUE == 2147483647, or 2_147_483_647, or a bit more than 2.1 billion). This phenomenon is called
integer overflow (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow) and happens because an int does not have space for
higher precision numbers (as it is 32 bits, only about 4 billion values can be represented accurately, and half of them
are negative values).

Since there are numbers larger than 2.1 billion that are occasionally useful, like the number of people on the planet,
Java also has a 'bigger int' called long. Try to adjust the program to use long values instead
of int. What is the number of Fibonacci numbers that you can correctly produce now (more than 46, hopefully)
